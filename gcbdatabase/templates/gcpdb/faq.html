            <p>1.  What is GCPDB?
                Gastric Cancer Proteomics DataBase (GCPDB) is resource of manually curated data on differentially expressed proteins identified through mass spectrometry experiments for identifying biomarkers for gastric cancers. Data is carefully curated from publicly available research articles related to gastric cancer. It includes data for over 7000 proteins in different clinical samples.

            <p>2. Why GCPDB?
                    Gastric cancer is a global health concern, mainly because of late diagnosis and poor prognosis. Discovery of protein biomarkers for diagnosing, predicting the prognosis and for therapeutic usage in gastric cancers is on the rise, especially with the discovery of high-throughput mass spectrometry. Due to the size and complexity of such data, markers are largely scattered and are not compiled from the current literature. Therefore, we compiled all altered proteins involved in gastric cancer manifestation which can be a one-point-resource for proteomics researchers working on gastric cancer.

            <p>3. How to search the data?
                        We provide a  user-friendly Browse and Batch Query option for fetching data from GCPDB. Data can be retrieved from Browse interface through searching the protein identifier or gene symbol.
